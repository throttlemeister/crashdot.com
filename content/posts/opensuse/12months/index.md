## Introduction

Well, here we are. A year after installing OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (actually, 14 months already) and we are still running it without much complaints, if any. Solid, fast, what more is there to ask for?

## Things I have noticed

Over this time period I have noticed some Things.

Pro:

1) Always the latest software
2) It does not fail, despite being a rolling release distribution
3) Easy to configure and customize ('ricing')
4) YaST let's you configure certaint things quicker and more reliable than you could on the commandline (iSCSI, NFS mounts)

Neg:

1) Sometimes (rarely) an update breaks something
2) Codecs are not in the main repos due to licensing and Packman repos are sometimes out of sync, forcing you to wait for specific updates
    - Typically this is not more than a few days, sometimes up to a week
3) Migration from nvidia to AMD could have been smoother, but not really something Tumbleweed is at fault for.
4) By default qgroups are enabled on BTRFS, which is good for snapshot management but can cause some performance issues.

## Summing up

Overall, very happy still. I wouldn't know what distribution to run that would make me more content running Liux on a day to day basis, really. It's a solid performer and with a nice balances of running the latest and greatest without too much risk of annoyances due to the proper testing that is done by OBS. I do look forward to trying out the new Cosmic desktop from System76 when it is released and made available, but I doubt I would be leaving my trusty and loved KDE behind.
