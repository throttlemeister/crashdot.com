## Introduction
So, the other day I was able to pick up a Ubiquiti Unifi 24 port POE switch for cheap. Fits right into the ecosystem of my network setup. However, since this is enterprise hardware and 19" rackmount hardware to boot, it is also not the most quiet of equipment to have setting in your office.

As it stands, the standard (load) fans can be easily replaced by similar fans from Noctua (NF 4x20 FLX) to make for a near silent experience. Here I will show what I did. And the difference it makes.

(more to come)
