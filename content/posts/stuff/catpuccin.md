## OMG
I am starting to see Catpuccin everywhere. I think I am obsessed. I know I am late to the party, but I find myself changing to Catpuccin everywhere I can. KDE colors? Catpuccin. Kitty terminal? Catpuccin. Alacritty? Catpuccin. Konsole? Catpuccin. Neovim? Catpuccin. Btop? Catpuccin. Zen Browser? Catpuccin. It's everywhere.

I love it.

It also makes for a nice consistent experience.

Did I mention I love it?

Gotta find more.....
