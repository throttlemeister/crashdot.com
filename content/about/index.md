This is my little corner of the web where I put the articles I write on Linux and other tech. Mostly for my own reference, as I run into things or try to fix something for myself. And if I think it is something someone else could also benefit from, I will put it up.

Who am I? I am a former IT consultant that started as a UNIX and Linux admin way back in the 90's. And while I do not work in the field any longer, I still love to tinker and privately nerd out. I also enjoy riding my motorcyclces, travel and photography.
