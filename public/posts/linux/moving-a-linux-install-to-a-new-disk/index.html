<h1>Moving a Linux install to a new disk</h1>

Nov. 8, 2021


<br/><br/>
<p>Recently I had to move my Linux install from one drive to another, as I was experiencing some issues with a WD SN550 nvme drive causing some short random freezes of the GUI with IO intensive tasks. Since I also have a Samsung nvme drive installed, I decided to see if the problem persists on the other drive.</p>
<p>But. Having a fully configured and customized Linux install is a pain in the behind to redo. I did not want to clone, because I made a mistake during install the previous time and it installed in legacy MBR mode, so I wanted to do a proper install using UEFI mode. But preferably not having to re-do all the setup and customizations.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have to. Apt to the rescue.</p>
<pre><code>$ apt-mark showauto  pkgs_auto.lst
$ apt-mark showmanual pkgs_manual.lst
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a list of .deb packages installed on the system. The first one with all the automatically installed packages, the second one all the manually installed packages from the commandline.</p>
<p>I also made a backup of <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code> and <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code>. The first directory contains all the repositories I had in use on the original install, and the second directory holds all the GPG keys that go with these repositories. Important!</p>
<p>First install the system on the new drive, and make sure all updates are installed. You don&rsquo;t need to install or setup anything but the base system. Now you can continue with the back ups and files you created earlier.</p>
<p>After I moved the two directories above to their respective place on the new install, and of course doing an sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade to make sure all packages are still up to date, I loaded up the list of packages I created earlier.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install $(cat pkgs_auto.lst)
$ sudo apt install $(cat pkgs_manual.lst)
</code></pre>
<p>This will create some errors due to packages that cannot be installed like this, or packages that were installed from a .deb file and aren&rsquo;t located in any repository. Clean up those entries, and try again and let it run.</p>
<p>When it is finished, copy your /home/<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from your old drive to your new drive and when you reboot and log back in as your user, everything should be just as it was before.</p>
<p>Success!</p>
