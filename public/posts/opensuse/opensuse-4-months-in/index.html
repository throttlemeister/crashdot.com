<h1>OpenSUSE: 4 months in</h1>

Dec. 4, 2023


<br/><br/>
<p>Maybe it is time for a little update, even if there is not much to say. After 4 months of running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I can honestly say I have not had a single moment where I&rsquo;d thought I should maybe look for another distribution because XYZ is getting too annoying.</p>
<p>Of course it does have some annoyances. Some are with me, like running systemd-boot while it is not officially ready for primetime yet. Others are with OpenSUSE or my setup, like sometimes an update will bork the system and I have to do a snapper rollback. Fortunately, OpenSUSE makes this a 2 minute job and so far, rolling back the update and installing it again is all that is needed to fix the system and the update.</p>
<p>Other than that, I can&rsquo;t even really think of anything. It just works. It runs, it runs fast, I have all the latest packages as you can expect using a rolling release and I just get to enjoy using my computer and play around with it. Both my desktop as well as my laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to be able to use the computers without this itch or little doubt that makes one go and look for greener pastures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still impressed, really impressed with OpenSUSE. More should be using it, it really is that good. And a bit of counterweight to the giants like Canonical and Redhat would be nice too.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
