<h1>Interesting (or: first tiling windows manager experience)</h1>

Oct. 13, 2023


<br/><br/>
<p>The other night, I was playing around watching YouTube videos and was watching this one video from Brodie Robertson on how he was now using Hyprland as his daily driver. Usually, I just zone out to other tasks when the topic gets to a tiling window manager, as it is not for me: I have a ultrawide screen on my desktop, with a 3440x1440 resolution and trust me, you do not want to run console fullscreen.</p>
<p>But, as I was sitting with my laptop in my lap which obviously has a more common resolution display, I thought what the heck. Let&rsquo;s see if OpenSUSE offers Hyprland in its repos and see what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>Well, it was in the repos and to my suprise it didn&rsquo;t suck. I mean, I still prefer a normal desktop for desktop tasks, but for managing my network and homelab from my laptop, where I pretty much live in (multiple) terminal sessions and a some of browser tabs on a different workspace, this works. And pretty good too, with great focus on what you need to achieve.</p>
<p>I like, again to my suprise</p>
<p>On a sidenote: does anyone know how to use tiling window manager on a ultrawide screen, where you do not want a single application to go fullscreen, but remain restricted to just part of the screen, let&rsquo;s say a third of the screen. Or top/bottom half vertically and a third horizontally. Having essentially two screens side by side in a single panel is a dream from a screen real estate point of view, but its a nightmare for using a tiling window manager imo, especially if you take care organizing your windows.</p>
