      <title>Transactional updates on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed</title>

      <description>It’s possible to use transactional or atomic updates on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and leveraging the snapshot capabilities of btrfs. It’s actually quite simple; all you need to do is to install the command using zipper.&#xA;Important prerequisite: the filesystem must be btrfs.&#xA;sudo zypper in transactional-update This will install the command. Next you want to set up some, to prevent some potential issues.&#xA;# Note: this systemd service is required to create RPM dirs in /var as TU # does not mount /var in the new snapshot to maintain atomicity.</description>

      <title>Managing dotfiles using stow on Linux</title>

      <description>One thing that’s always a bit of a pain when you use multiple computers, or when you want to reinstall your computer at some point in time is that you have to recreate your configuration files or ‘dotfiles’ to have everything back as you want again.&#xA;There are several ways of doing this, but recently I came across a little tool called GNU stow. It is a much easier way of managing dotfiles than for instance using a git bare repository.</description>

      <title>systemd-boot on OpenSUSE</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/sdboot/</link>

      <description>I am weird sometimes, I know. Ever since I used Pop!OS, which uses systemd-boot as default boot manager, I have fallen in love with it. The simplicity and speed of systemd-boot versus the complexity and bulk of GRUB2 just won me over.&#xA;Mind you, GRUB2 is very good at what it does. It’s just that I don’t need all it does. All I need is to boot my machine, nothing more, nothing less.</description>

      <title>A couple little Windows things</title>

      <description>I recently had a discussion on a forum on the usefulness of virtual desktops and the implementation on Windows 10. Now everyone can have their opinions on virtual desktops and I do as well, but in that discussion some things came up that are apparently not so well known.&#xA;Some people find it cumbersome to switch between virtual desktops to the point it becomes unusable for them. They need to go to Task View (WIN+TAB), then use the mouse to click the desktop they want.</description>

      <description>Introduction WSL 2 on Windows 10 introduced the ability to run a native linux kernel on your computer while using Windows 10 as your main operating system. Instead of emulating a Linux kernel, like WSL 1 does, WSL 2 uses a lightweight hypervisor to run linux in parallel with Windows.&#xA;To be able to run WSL 2 on Windows 10, installation of Windows 10 feature update 2004 is required.&#xA;An explanation on how to enable WSL2 support can be found on the page detailing how to create a Gentoo instance on WSL2.</description>

      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>

      <description>This is my little corner of the web where I put the articles I write on Linux and other tech. Mostly for my own reference, as I run into things or try to fix something for myself. And if I think it is something someone else could also benefit from, I will put it up.&#xA;Who am I? I am a former IT consultant that started as a UNIX and Linux admin way back in the 90&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
