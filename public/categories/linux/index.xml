      <description>Since I have moved to running Linux basically full time, I have ran Pop!OS, Fedora, Nobara, back to Fedora KDE Spin and now OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. All of them are good distributions and none have any real deal-breakers for me not to want to use them.&#xA;The fact that I really, really like Tumbleweed was not a given. Quite the contrary. OpenSUSE does it&amp;rsquo;s own thing, so it is a bit of a learning curve if you are used to Debian-based or RedHat-based distributions.</description>

      <description>This is a quick post on how to run multiple instances of AdGuard@Home on a single Synology host using Docker.&#xA;Problem: you cannot easily, using Docker, run multiple instances of the same program - or different program - while listening on the same port.&#xA;Solution: do not use host or bridge networking, but put the container on the same network as the host using macvlan.&#xA;To achieve this, we need to do the following:</description>

      <title>New laptop, new Linux distro</title>

      <description>I finally got fed up with my Macbook Pro as a Linux laptop. It was a 2012 model, no longer supported by Apple. But the quirky implementation of Nvidia discrete graphics on the Macbook wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best for reliable Linux operation. Mind you, Nvidia is always a bit of a challenge, but Apple being Apple certainly does not help in that regard.&#xA;Anyway, I am currently sporting a Lenovo T460 from 2016.</description>

      <description>For the longest time, I have been monitoring my network and homelab using Observium. This worked and does work very well. Observium is very good at what it does. However, there are a couple of things that do not work so well for me using Observium:&#xA;Observium does not let me add applications to monitor very easily or at all Observium is limited to what can be offered through SNMP Observium is not open source and as such it cannot be modified or changed to your needs Observium is not an application I have come across in my professional life, so knowing how it works does not help me professionally.</description>
