                Well, here we are, 6 months after installing OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and still no urge to change. The only change I am longing for is the update to KDE Plasma 6, which should be coming soon now that it has officially been released.
Since there are basically no updates since my last post in December, there isn&rsquo;t much to say. I did however made some changes. A couple of weeks ago, my GTX1080 decided to shit itself such that it triggers the short protection in the power supply so that&rsquo;s out.

                Maybe it is time for a little update, even if there is not much to say. After 4 months of running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I can honestly say I have not had a single moment where I&rsquo;d thought I should maybe look for another distribution because XYZ is getting too annoying.
Of course it does have some annoyances. Some are with me, like running systemd-boot while it is not officially ready for primetime yet.

                The other night, I was playing around watching YouTube videos and was watching this one video from Brodie Robertson on how he was now using Hyprland as his daily driver. Usually, I just zone out to other tasks when the topic gets to a tiling window manager, as it is not for me: I have a ultrawide screen on my desktop, with a 3440x1440 resolution and trust me, you do not want to run console fullscreen.

                Since I have moved to running Linux basically full time, I have ran Pop!OS, Fedora, Nobara, back to Fedora KDE Spin and now OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. All of them are good distributions and none have any real deal-breakers for me not to want to use them.
The fact that I really, really like Tumbleweed was not a given. Quite the contrary. OpenSUSE does it&rsquo;s own thing, so it is a bit of a learning curve if you are used to Debian-based or RedHat-based distributions.
